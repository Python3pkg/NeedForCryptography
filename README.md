About Undercover
----------

Undercover is meant to be a cryptographic library. It will provide solutions for main problems in cryptography and many ciphers(some of them often used and other for educational purposes only). The project is inspired by the [Cryptography](http://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/algebra/cryptodescr.shtml) course at FMI.
